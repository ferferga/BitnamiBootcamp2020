# Bitnami Bootcamp 2020

This repository contains the exercises made during the Bitnami Bootcamp which
took place in 2020 in Seville.

Each day of the bootcamp will be divided in its own branch, with each exercise in its
**own subfolder** (which may be merged in master under **SessionX** folders). Some of the exercises were not mandatory.
However, I decided to put all of them into one ``NON-DELIVERABLE.md`` file for each day, just for archival purposes.

## LICENSE

Everything (but what is under the ``assets`` folder) was created by me, so consider that to be **MIT Licensed**.

However, what lies under the ``assets`` folder (from now on: *materials*) was authored by the Bitnami's instructors of the bootcamp.
Here are their names and GitHub users:

* [Javier Salmerón](https://github.com/javsalgar)
* [Juan Ariza Toledano](https://github.com/juan131)
* [Juan José Martos](https://github.com/jotamartos)
* [Tomás Pizarro](https://github.com/tompizmor)
* [Alejandro Moreno](https://github.com/alemorcuq)
* [Miguel Ángel Cabrera Miñagorri](https://github.com/miguelaeh)
* [Carlos Rodríguez Hernández](https://github.com/carrodher)


Back in the day, I was given verbal consent by the instructors to do "whatever I wanted" with the materials.
This is why I provide them here (as the full explanation of the exercises and the project can also be useful for other people learning Docker),
**but that doesn't necessarily mean that you can use it in commercial projects or anything besides free educational purposes**,
as the consent was given just to me.

No other indication were given by them and Bitnami/VMWare for their materials, **so use at your own risk**. You're better off contacting them requesting permission in case of doubt.

I have no problems in fulfilling any request to remove their work in case they want their consent revoked.
Contact me and I will proceed as requested, dropping the commit and requesting GitHub to clear git's cache.
