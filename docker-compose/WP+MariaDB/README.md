This docker-compose project creates a basic
setup of two containers. One container has the WP instance running, while the other one
has a MariaDB instance.

## Instructions for using

1. Download this docker-compose project in a folder inside your system where you have enough permissions
2. ``cd`` to that directory
3. Run ``docker-compose up`` and enjoy!

For stopping the containers, run ``docker-compose down -v``
